# Multi-View Collaborative Topic Regression

Abstract:
Collaborative filtering is widely used in recommender systems across domains like e-commerce and movie streaming to boost user engagement and satisfaction. However, these systems often struggle with the "cold start" problemâ€”figuring out what to recommend to new users or how to recommend new items when no rating data is available. To tackle this issue, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes historical ratings, along with user, item, and additional categorical features, to create embedding vectors for users and items in cold-start scenarios. Our approach also allows for updating user and item rating predictions as new data becomes available. Additionally, we introduce a novel discrete latent variable model called \textit{multi-view collaborative topic regression} (MVCTR) and compare its performance to current state-of-the-art latent variable models.
